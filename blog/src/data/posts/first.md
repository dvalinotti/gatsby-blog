### Welcome to my blog!
My name's Dan, and I'm a full-stack software engineer. I'm starting this blog
because I want a place to empty my thoughts and opinions somewhere so that they aren't 
stuck in my brain. Whether or not this is seen by anyone is secondary to just getting 
the writing done. I'm not sure at the moment what I'm going to talk about, but I'm 
assuming it will consist mostly of ranting about tech, languages and frameworks that
are driving me mad on any given day. The goal of this whole project is that I learn 
about developing a blog site and (hopefully) become a better writer in general. But
we'll see how that goes.
